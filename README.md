# Yelp-Stream-Data-Processing

In this assignment, I have implemented three algorithms: the Bloom filtering, Flajolet-Martin algorithm, and reservoir sampling. For the first task, Bloom Filtering is implemented for off-line Yelp business dataset. For the second and the third task, I have worked with on-line
streaming data directly. In the second task, I generate a simulated data stream with the Yelp dataset and implement Flajolet-Martin algorithm with Spark Streaming library.
The third task involves some analysis on Twitter stream using fixed size sampling (Reservoir Sampling).
